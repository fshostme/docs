# Pro Pricing Updates from Jan 2026

We've been improving our Pro offering since we introduce it in 2022 and it's time we brought the pricing inline with what we offer.<br/><br/>
This will come into effect 1st Jan 2026 and will be applicable to **new Pro servers only**.<br/>
If you want to keep your existing pricing, keep your current servers active but not letting it expire and delete.
