This update delivers impactful improvements and fixes to elevate your experience!<br/>

## ✏️  Changes
**MatchZy & MapChange**
   - The system now detects `!map` commands and delays `tv_stoprecord` during map changes.
   - This helps prevent server crashes, especially if your match isn’t fully completed.
   - Warmup configurations now launch seamlessly when a `!map` command is used.
   - This eliminates issues that previously interrupted pre-game setups.

**We're actively working on enabling the use of commands like `!mapname` (e.g., `!dust2`, `!nuke`, `!mirage`, etc.) for a more streamlined experience.**

However, this feature won’t be available in the current update. In the meantime, we encourage you to continue using `!map dust2`, `!map mirage`, and similar commands as a **temporary workaround**.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
**DemoURL to Discord**
  - We’ve fixed an issue with the MapChange plugin and CSTV2Discord that was causing duplicate URLs to be sent to Discord channels. (confirmed through local testing)
