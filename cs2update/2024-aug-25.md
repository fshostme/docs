## ✏️ Changes
**MatchZy**

**Coach:**
- Multiple coaches are now allowed, players can use `.coach ct/t` to coach any team.
- Fixed C4 glitch if the coach gets the C4. Now, the C4 will be dropped at the base if the coach has the C4. Players can either use buy menu to get the dropped C4, or grab it once the round starts.
- Fixed coach blocking smoke lineups. Now, the coaches will be invisible (only their name will be visible, atm no fix for hide that)
- Fixed coach getting some information on round start (buy in hud, money in scoretab, etc). Now coaches will die 1 second before the freezetime ends.

**Match Mode:**
- Now the players will automatically join their respective team, skipping the join team menu. (When a match is loaded)

**Practice:**
- Fixed a bug where loading a saved nade would make the player stuck. Now newly saved nades will not have this issue.

**General:**
- Added `matchzy_removeplayer` command to remove and kick a player from all the teams when a match is loaded. Usage: `matchzy_removeplayer <steam64>`
