**New features & fixes**<br/>

We apologize for the issues this past weekend. We've been working hard to get everything back on track, and we now believe we've cracked the code — everything should be running smoothly again.

Below, you’ll find a brief changelog.

## MatchZy
- Resolved an issue where `tv_record` was saving demos to the wrong folder.
- Improved visibility for when a recording is in progress and when it has stopped.

## CSTVDiscord
- Fixed an issue with an incorrect DemoURL.

## FixTV
- Added a plugin to automatically reset CSTV after match completion (e.g., Match), intended for use with MatchZy.
