End of the 2024 Year Updates<br/>

## ✏️  Changes
- The `!map` command now accepts uppercase letters, which previously caused crashes on our free CS2 servers. (e.g., `!map DE_DUST2` or similar map names).
- `fake_rcon changelevel/map` automatically detects both `de_dust2` and `DE_DUST2`, ensuring map changes occur seamlessly without crashing the free CS2 servers.
- We've made some minor adjustments to MatchZy on our Pro servers.

Happy New Year to everyone! 🎉
