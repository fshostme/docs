Big Update - **You Asked, We Delivered!**<br/>

## ✏️  Changes
- MatchZy has been **revamped**, and we’re making some important changes to how .CFG files are handled.
  - From now on, each server will have its own dedicated .CFG file for MatchZy.

**What does this mean for you?**
This change allows us to take **customization requests** based on your preferences. Want to tweak something? Let us know!

For example, you can now request:
- Chat Prefix changes
- Changes to **live.cfg**, **knife.cfg** or **scrim.cfg**
- Modifications to config.cfg, like enabling practice mode to autostart by default

We’re excited to bring you these enhancements and look forward to your requests!

**If your CS2 server hasn't been automatically restarted, you will need to restart it manually for these changes to take effect.**
