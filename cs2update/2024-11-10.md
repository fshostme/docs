In today's news, we've made some small changes and additions.<br/>

## ✏️  Changes
**MatchZy**
- Reintroduced the `.playout` command and added `.po` as aliases. (You can continue using `.scrim` as usual; nothing has changed.)
- Added a new scrim mode/config, `.hill`, which provides full buy money ($16,000 per round).

There is no difference between `.playout` and `.scrim` they perform exactly the same function.
