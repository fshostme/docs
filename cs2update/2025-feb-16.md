**Exciting Updates for MatchZy!**<br/>

## MatchZy
- `.tech` is no longer restricted by the remaining 2 calls.
- Added support on KnifeRound for `!pause` and `!unpause` commands, as well as `.fup` and `.fp` for admins (previously not possible by default).
- Fixed a bug when using `.restart` from e.g. `.scrim`) that it had not reset scrim/playout setting, causing it to remain enabled.
