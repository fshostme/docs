A small update<br/>

## ✏️  Changes
- The `!kick` and `!ban` commands have been re-enabled from the `!admin` menu (included the commands for say/say_team)
- We has updated CounterStrikeSharp to v300
- Yesterday we also fixed a small bug by switching “from matchzy to retakes” as the enemy nade trajectory had not been disabled.
