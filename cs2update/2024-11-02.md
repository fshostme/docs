## ✏️  Changes
**CS2-SimpleAdmin**
- Updated to the latest menu (can be controlled with your keyboard using W/S, E and R)
- Added a new command available to manage enable/disable plugins.

**CS2MapChange**
- Removed `!wsmap` from this plugin as **CS2-SimpleAdmin plugin** will take over the command instead.
