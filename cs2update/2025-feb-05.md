**Hold on... Looks like improvements have arrived once more! ðŸŽ‰**<br/>

### ðŸ”„ **MatchZy Fixes**
- At the end of the match there have been some 'statistics' files that matchzy unfortunately saves as `match_data_map0_-1.csv` file, this has been fixed in our own version (this is a bug in the original version).
- Changed the 'team name' format when the match/scrim is in progress so that we now use `team_XXXX` by default (Example: `team_FSHOST`)

### ðŸ”Œ **Updated: AdminLogin/AddAdmin Plugin**
- Added a new command that makes it extremely easy to make yourself server admin on your own server. (Welcome to `/permlogin` from our old CSGO service)


Got ideas to make MatchZy better or spot an issue? Weâ€™d love to hear from you! Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve the plugin for everyone.<br />
<small>While we canâ€™t guarantee every suggestion will result in changes, we promise to review them with care.</small>
