This update delivers impactful improvements and essential fixes to elevate your experience!<br/>

## ✏️ Changes
**MatchZy**
- The demo recording message (DemoStartMessage) will now be displayed **only after the `.match` goes LIVE**. This change ensures a cleaner experience, applicable exclusively for `.match` setups.
- Team intros (controlled by `mp_team_intro_time`) will no longer play during knife rounds, ensuring a quicker and more focused start to these pivotal initial rounds.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
**MatchZy**
- Resolved a potential issue where the default knife round could inadvertently be disabled when transitioning from `.scrim` to `.match` (where knife rounds are typically enabled by default). This update ensures that knife rounds are now reliably enforced for matches, providing a seamless and consistent experience.
