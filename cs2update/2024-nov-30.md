Today's update brings exciting new features, improvements, and fixes to enhance your experience!<br/>

## 🚀 New Features
**MatchZy**
- Added a new message for the `!prac` command on servers with "Bots disabled," which can now be addressed using `.bot`, `.nobots` or `.tbot`
- Admins now automatically receive a message with available commands upon their first connection.
- Introduced a 10-second delay for KnifeRound and MatchStart initiation (this does not apply to `.scrim` and `.hill` modes).

## ✏️ Changes
**MatchZy**
- The `.knife` command now toggles the kniferound on/off directly. The `.rk on/off` command is no longer required, simplifying usage. You can now use `.knife`, `.rk`, or `.kr`.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
**MatchZy**
- Fixed an issue where the warmup phase would not execute if a server was loaded in match mode by default (instead of Practice Mode).
