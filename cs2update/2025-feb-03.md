**Wait...something has been improvements again** ðŸŽ‰<br/>

### ðŸ”„ **MatchZy Fixes & Patches**
- **Practice Mode:** Players who have used the `.spec` command can now switch to the CT or T side using `.ct` or `.t` without restrictions. We've also added the `.nobreak` alias for the `.breakrestore` command.
- **Team Name Updates:** The commands `.ctname` and `.tname` now allow for dynamic "Team Name" changes during ongoing matches without interruptions.
- **Minor Error Fixes:** Addressed small issues affecting game consistency and plugin execution.

### ðŸ”Œ **New Self-Made Plugin: !nextmap**
- Admins can now set the next map via the `!nextmap` command, dynamically changing the map scheduled at the end of a match.
   - Example: `!nextmap inferno` sets the server to load Inferno when the match concludes.
   - Integrated with the scoreboard countdown for smooth map transitions.
