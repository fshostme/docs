## Introduction

**MTR** (My Traceroute) and **WinMTR** are tools used to track how data travels from your computer to a server, and to identify where delays or losses may occur along the way. They continuously send packets to each hop on the route to a target host and measure performance at every step. These tools are especially useful for identifying network degradation affecting services like game servers, streaming, and VoIP.

In this guide, you'll learn how to install and use MTR or WinMTR to identify and troubleshoot network problems like high latency and packet loss.

## Why Use MTR or WinMTR?

When users experience poor network performance ‚Äî like lag in games, buffering in streams, or voice chat disruptions ‚Äî the issue could be anywhere along the network route: from the user's ISP to internet exchanges, or even within the data center itself.

**MTR and WinMTR** provide real-time, hop-by-hop analysis of packet loss and latency. This allows both users and support teams to pinpoint where problems occur.

### What MTR Helps You Detect:

- **Intermittent loss**: Temporary drops at one hop that do not persist may be firewall filtering and not a problem.
- **Persistent loss after a hop**: If packet loss starts at a node and continues through all subsequent ones, this indicates real packet loss.
- **Latency anomalies**: High `Avg` or `Wrst` values on a particular hop can highlight routing or congestion issues.
- **Firewall filtering**: A single hop reporting 100% loss but later hops responding normally usually means ICMP is being filtered.

Providing a complete MTR or WinMTR report during the incident allows data centers to analyze problems with precision.

## Installation

### Windows (WinMTR)

You can download WinMTR for Windows from the [FSHOST](https://help.fshost.me/WinMTR.zip) page.

1. Unzip and launch the program.
2. Enter the IP address or hostname you want to test (e.g., the game server).
3. Click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù to begin the test.
4. Run the test during the issue for accurate results.
5. Click ‚ÄúCopy Text to clipboard‚Äù or export to save your report.

---

### Linux (MTR)

MTR can be installed on Linux using your package manager. It must be run via SSH on the server or local machine.

To install:

```bash
sudo apt install -y mtr-tiny
```

To start a test:

```bash
mtr [IP or hostname]
```

Stop the test with `Ctrl + C` once sufficient data is collected.

## Creating a Useful Report

1. Perform the MTR/WinMTR test **while the issue is occurring**.
2. Include both outbound (from you to server) and inbound (server to you) tests if possible.
3. Copy and share the full report, preferably in text format.
4. Avoid screenshots unless absolutely necessary, as raw text is easier to analyze.

---

## Evaluating the Results

When reading a report, consider:

- **Consistent packet loss** across multiple hops usually points to an upstream issue.
- **Loss at a single node** that doesn‚Äôt continue downstream is often a filtering firewall.
- High `Wrst` or `StDev` may indicate instability, even if packet loss is low.
- Contact support with this report to help them pinpoint and escalate the issue efficiently.

## Understanding Packet Loss in MTR Reports

Interpreting packet loss correctly is essential. Not all loss is a problem ‚Äî some is expected or intentional (e.g., due to security filters). Below are common scenarios and what they usually mean:

### üîê Loss at an Early Hop (Firewall or DDoS Protection)

**Example:**

```
2. firewall.provider.net          100%   100   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---
3. router.upstream.net             0%    100   15    16    14    20
```

‚úÖ **This is normal.**  
Some firewalls or anti-DDoS systems intentionally block ICMP/ping replies to avoid abuse. If the *next hops respond normally* with 0% packet loss, there is **no problem**.

---

### üõë Loss That Starts and Persists Across All Subsequent Hops

**Example:**

```
6. transit.provider.net           30%   100   55    60    54    120
7. core.router.datacenter.net     30%   100   60    65    55    130
8. destination.server.net         30%   100   63    67    57    140
```

üö® **This is a real issue.**  
If packet loss starts at a specific hop and continues all the way to the destination, it likely indicates a **problem at that node or upstream** ‚Äî such as congestion, misconfiguration, or a faulty router.

---

### üéØ Loss Only at the Final Hop (Destination)

**Example:**

```
10. destination.server.net        20%   100   60    70    59    120
```

üü† **May or may not be a problem.**  
If only the last hop shows loss, check if services (like a game or website) are actually having issues. Some servers deprioritize or drop ICMP echo replies ‚Äî so occasional packet loss here could be **harmless**.

But if users are actively experiencing disconnects, rubberbanding, or buffering, the **packet loss at the destination is real and significant**.

---

### üß± One Hop Shows 100% Loss, Others Don‚Äôt

**Example:**

```
5. private.firewall.net           100%   100   ---   ---   ---   ---
6. core.backbone.net               0%    100   30    35    29    50
```

‚úÖ **Not a problem.**  
This is **ICMP filtering** ‚Äî the hop received the packet but chose not to reply. Because all subsequent hops respond normally, the connection isn't impacted.

---

### üåê Loss in the First Few Hops (Local Network or ISP)

**Example:**

```
1. home.router.local              0%    100
2. isp-gateway.local               5%    100
3. upstream.core.isp               8%    100
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Check your local setup or contact your ISP.**  
Loss in the first few hops usually means the problem is **closer to you**, such as:

- Wi-Fi interference or signal degradation
- Faulty Ethernet cable
- Problems at your ISP‚Äôs edge

Try retesting using a wired connection and rebooting your router or modem.
