Weâ€™ve introduced the ability to enter an **RCON password** in the "Edit Server" section for Minecraft Pro servers. 

This feature allows you to grant yourself operator ("op") status directly in the game.

### Important Note:
This functionality is only supported on **PaperMC** servers.

### Commands:
- `/login <rconpass>`: Automatically grants you operator status.
- `/ops`: Displays a list of current operators on your server.
