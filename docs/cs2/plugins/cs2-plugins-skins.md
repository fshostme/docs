**Unfinished, unoptimized and not fully functional ugly WeaponPaints plugin**

:::note
**You should be aware that the plugin is very unstable and you will therefore experience a loss packet on your server. And perhaps also high ping.**
<br />

**We recommend that you do not activate it in-game if you are not going to use the WeaponPaints plugin.**
:::

## Features
- You can change paint, seed and wear on weapons, knives, gloves and agents. (**Web version**)
