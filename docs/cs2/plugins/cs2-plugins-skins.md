**Unfinished, unoptimized, and partially functional WeaponPaints plugin.**

## Features
- Change paint, seed, and wear on weapons, knives, gloves, and agents (Web version).
- Data syncs automatically when players connect.

**[Change your skin/float or seed on this link](https://skins.fsho.st)**

Use the search bar below to find a command:

import CommandSearch from '@site/src/components/CommandSearch';
import skinsCommands from '@site/src/data/commands/skinsCommands';

<CommandSearch commandCategories={skinsCommands} />

**We recommend using the website for more advanced customization, such as adjusting float/seed or selecting skins for individual weapons.**

## MVP Kits
Before you can use the `!music` MVP. Make sure to select the default CS2 Music Kit from your in-game inventory before it can function!
