This is a private plugin for our FSHOST Pro Server where we have made it easier for YOU to add yourself OR your teammates as administrator on your CS2 game server.

:::note
**You won't be added as admin automatically by using `/login`.**
<br />
Please use `/addadmin <target>` to add yourself or your friend as admin.
<br />**Example target**:
<br />SteamID64
<br />Steam-Nickname
