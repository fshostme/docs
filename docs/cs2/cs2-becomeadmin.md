## Introduction

Using administrator privileges allows you to manage the server in-game. This gives you the ability to execute commands through the console.

## Prerequisites
To use administrator privileges, a foundation must first be established. By default, CS2 does not offer comprehensive administration management. However, there are frameworks for this purpose, such as CounterStrikeSharp.
