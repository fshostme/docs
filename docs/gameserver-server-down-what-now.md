## Introduction

If your game server is down, this can have many reasons. **It is important that you don't try to restart it directly, but take a look at the log file first. There are usually** **error messages** which describe why exactly the server crashed.** **If you restart the server directly, the log is regenerated and the old one is deleted. Then unfortunately you can't see any more errors.**
