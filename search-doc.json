GSL Token  Gameserver Login Tokens (GSLTs) is a procedure that Steam has implemented as a protective measure. To run gameservers of certain Steam Games (mainly source games) it is necessary to generate a token. More detailed information can be found here:  Gameserver Login Token  Gametype  There are different gamemodes. In the following you see a list of all available options:  Classic CasualClassic CompetitiveDeathmatchWingman  Mapgroup  Mapgroups are groups of maps which normally correspond to a certain category. By default there are the mg_active, mg_allclassic groups. Optionally you can create your own. This has to be added to the gamemodes_server.txt. The structure of such a mapgroup is easy to build and looks like this:  { &quot;mg_meine_mapgroup&quot; { &quot;name&quot;\t&quot;mg_meine_mapgroup&quot; &quot;maps&quot; { &quot;de_map1&quot;\t&quot;&quot; &quot;de_map2&quot;\t&quot;&quot; &quot;de_map3&quot;\t&quot;&quot; &quot;de_map4&quot;\t&quot;&quot; } } }   Startmap  The start map is used to determine which map should be loaded during the startup process.
